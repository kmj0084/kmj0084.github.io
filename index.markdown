# Hi there! I'm Keegan Johnson
I'm a HR Data Scientist and baseball enthusiast. I love to analyze "people data," and am interested in exploring optimal nudges in microeconomics contexts (aka good ole incentives). Check out some of my projects below or go to [Sabermetrics](/saber), and feel free to get in touch via email or LinkedIn.
